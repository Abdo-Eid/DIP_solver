# Digital Image Processing Helper

## Introduction

This project provides tools for solving Digital Image Processing (DIP) problems, aimed at helping me and my colleagues practice and understand core concepts in DIP.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   ```bash
   cd DIP_solver
   ```
3. **(Optionally) if you will contribute make virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
   **Activate the virtual environment**
   ```bash
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **Install requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install the Package**
   if you will contribute install the package in your environment in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

   install the package and dependencies in your environment:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

## Getting Started

> **Note:** Using this project in IDLE or an interactive Python environment is recommended.

1. **Import the Package**  
   Start by importing the package:
   ```python
   from DIP.helper import make_random
   ```

2. **Create a Random Matrix**  
   You can generate a random matrix with the function `make_random(width: int = 3, height: int = 3, bit_depth: int = 8) -> Matrix`.
   ```python
   width = 3
   height = 3
   bit_depth = 8
   img1 = make_random(width, height, bit_depth)
   ```

3. **Choose a Kernel**  
   Import a predefined kernel from the `Kernels` class:
   ```python
   from DIP.neighborhood_operations import Kernals
   kernel1 = Kernals.smoothing_filter
   ```

4. **Display Matrices**  
   Display one or more matrices using `display_matrices(list_of_matrices: List[Matrix], text: Optional[List[str]] = None, coordinates: bool = False)`:
   ```python
   display_matrices([img1, kernel1])
   ```
   Sample output:
   ```
   Matrix 1:
   [ 125 208 136 ]
   [ 130   1 240 ]
   [  93 207 170 ]

   Matrix 2:
   [ 0.111 0.111 0.111 ]
   [ 0.111 0.111 0.111 ]
   [ 0.111 0.111 0.111 ]
   ```

## The Story

The project started because I wanted to understand the implementation of some algorithms and operations for a college course on Digital Image Processing. At first, I built it in NumPyâ€”faster, and I just wanted to learn the concepts. But then I thought, why not make it **pure Python**? This way, there are no external libraries needed, and I could share the code with my classmates so they could use it to solve any problem they wanted.

Then the idea grew: why not make a TUI (Text-based User Interface) and quiz app that sticks to this DIY principle? I decided to build it entirely myself to deepen my understanding and give my classmates a useful, accessible tool.

## What I Learned

- Writing clear and helpful documentation
- Using Pydoc and focusing on self-explanatory code
- Creating guides on using code effectively
- Gaining deeper knowledge of Python
- Using mkdocs to auto-generate documentaion with docstring
- using github actions to auto build the documentaion on new releases

## What's Next

- Reimplement the project using NumPy and OOP principles
- make a text base user interface (TUI)
