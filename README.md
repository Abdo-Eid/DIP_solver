## intro

this is a small project to help me and my collegs in solving DIP (digital image processing) problems and practice it.

# The Story

the project started as I wanted to know how the implementation of some algorithms and operations in a collage course for Digital Image Processing so it was implemented in numpy (faster and I only want to learn the concept) but after a while I said why not make it **pure python**? so no external librarys needed, and then give the code to my colleges to use it to solve any problem they want... then I said why not already make a TUI (Text based User Interface) quizzes app and adhering to the principal I tried to make it my self.

# what i learned
- how to document a python code focused
- using pydocs and focus self explanatory code
- also making docs for how to use the code
- learning a lot more about python

# to-do
-   [ ] add bit depth for max value of segmentaion in thresholding
-   [ ] adding a steps parameter to show the steps of the algorithm
-   [ ] add give me a question option (chose a thing, gives you matrix a pixel to work on or just work on the whole thing then waits for you answer and can calc time)
-   [x] resize function not like lecture

# what's next

-   use pure python in your code so that you can turn it into js for web
